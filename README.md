Background : 
From vegetable production to delivery, several common steps are operated manually. 
Like picking, and sorting vegetables. Therefore, we decided to solve this problem using deep neural architecture, 
by developing a model that can detect and classify vegetables. That model can be implemented in different types of devices and 
can also solve other problems related to the identification of vegetables, like labeling the vegetables automatically without any 
need for human work.

Datasets :
This dataset contains three folders: train (15000 images) test (3000 images) validation (3000 images) each of the above folders contains subfolders for different vegetables wherein the images for respective vegetables are present.

Objective :
Make a CNN Model to classify Vegetables
